      A rational decision maker will, when presented with a choice, take the action with the greatest expected utility.

    Thinking about it intuitively... what does that even mean? Utility = preference. It's a measure of how much you prefer a certain outcome. So by saying, "I'm going to choose the outcome that has the highest expected utility", it basically means, "I'm going to choose the outcome that I think I prefer most."

    There are some "edge cases" though. Check out the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-normative-utility/#CouExpUtiThe">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> for a discussion.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    I tried to make ______ intuitive:
    <ul>
      <li>Expected utility calculations (just sum up the sizes of all the rectangles).</li>
      <li>The importance of the probability of an outcome happening (the width of the rectangle).</li>
      <li>The importance of the magnitude of an outcomes result (the height of the rectangle).</li>
      <li>
        Scope.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Humans are generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect">scope insensitive</a>. They can't <em>feel</em> that 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 is MUCH bigger than 1,000,000,000,000,000. With this app, you could actually see the sizes of the rectangles, and you could see that one is wayyyy larger than the other.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        That it makes sense to maximize expected utility.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Don't believe me? Run some simulations! You can choose the action with the lower expected utility, I'll chose the one with the larger expected utility. We can run some simulations, and I bet you'll lose!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Perhaps this could be used to help you make real life decisions? (By creating your own actions with outcomes.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Perhaps this could be used to visualize more theoretical decisions that you aren't making in your own life?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ie. "Is it a good idea for the Warriors to sign Kevin Durant? Well, if they do, maybe they'll lose Draymond Green? Maybe he'll fit with the offense, maybe he won't. Maybe the other guys will be unhappy with their shot attempts being taken away." You could create outcomes for each of the possibilities.
